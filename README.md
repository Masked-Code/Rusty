# WIP

This is a placeholder repo for an experimentation project. I am much more familiar and comfortable with creating Discord bots in Javascript, but I wish to expand my knowledge domain into Rust. This project will eventually be that experimentation. It is not meant to be a majorly functional or useful bot. Discord has also recently put inplace some extremely restrictive policies requarding bots so this project might be completely canceled.
